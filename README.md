## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Thanks for stopping by! I am currently working towards my Master's in Software Engineering. I'm all about making fun and accessible tools - especially for beginners.
## I'm currently developing something exciting and learning along the way.

---

## ðŸ§©What I'm Building
An interactive, story driven game where you solve Python (and later, C++) puzzles to "break out" of each room.

It is designed for people just starting their coding journey - making learning code feel more like a game instead of a chore.

---

## ðŸ§ What I'm Learning
- Python Fundamentals & Object-Oriented Programming
- Git & Github
- DevOp tools (Docker, GitHub Actions, Cloud Hosting)

---

## ðŸŽ¯Goals For This Year
- Launch the first version of my project
- Understand and apply real-world DevOps practices
- Help beginners fall in love with coding
